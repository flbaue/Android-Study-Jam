# Android-Study-Jam
All the material for the Android Study Jam at Women Techmakers Hamburg

Everything here is work in progress and up to discussion!

## WTM-Messenger
This is the reference app that we want to build during the course. The idea is a simple WhatsApp like chat application that uses Firebase as its backend.

### Proposed feature steps
Not all must be accomplished

1. Just being able to send end receive text messages and display them in a list.

2. Make users identifiable by a name

3. Users can create chat groups with individuals or groups

4. Send and receive images

5. Provide login functionality
